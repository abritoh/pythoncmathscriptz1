A python script to graphically represent complex numbers


Complex Numbers is a topic a ever wanted to write about, firstly because this is a subject (the Linear Algebra) which has applications practically in any Engineering field from signal processing, control theory, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, cartography and so on; secondly because of the mathematical capabilities of some programming languages like Python; but lets begin by supplying some definitions from official sources: 

<<A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction. The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head. Two vectors are the same if they have the same magnitude and direction. This means that if we take a vector and translate it to a new position (without rotating it), then the vector we obtain at the end of this process is the same vector we had in the beginning.>> [mathinsight.org]

<<Phasors are a means by which sinusoidal alternating voltages and currents can be specified in terms of a rotating radius and an angle, they behaving like vectors. A phasor represents a time-varying sinusoidal waveform by a fixed complex number. In other words a phasor is a complex number representing the amplitude and phase angle of a sinusoidal voltage and current. Phasors and complex impedances are only relevant to sinusoidal sources that have sine or cosine form.>> [sciencedirect.com]

<<A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is of the form a + ib and is usually represented by z; i is the square root of -1. Here both a and b are real numbers. The value 'a' is called the real part which is denoted by Re(z), and 'b' is called the imaginary part Im(z). Also, ib is called an imaginary number.>> [cuemath.com]

<<The rules for adding and subtracting complex numbers, namely to add or subtract corresponding components, are exactly the same as the rules for adding and subtracting vectors. Complex numbers behave exactly like two dimensional vectors. Indeed real numbers are one dimensional vectors (on a line) and complex numbers are two dimensional vectors (in a plane).>> [nrich.maths.org/]

Vectors have application on physics to represent quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, angular movement, etc; while phasors are specifically used in Electrical Engineering to analyze alternative current (AC) circuits; but these concepts rely on the mathematics behind complex numbers.

There are many manners to represent complex numbers, here are some of them: rectangular form, exponential form, polar form. Even when there exists some Applications like Matlab, Wolfram, Maple, Mathcad, etc, Python is one of the languages that includes the complex numbers as part of the fundamental data-types.

This is a Python-Script I created to deal with math & cmath modules and to implement graphical representations of complex number in rectangular and polar forms, Anaconda is a free-opensource distribution of the Python and R languages; Spyder is a scientific environment (IDE) written in Python, for Python.
